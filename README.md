# Quo Vadis, Skeleton Action Recognition ?

This repository contains datasets and scripts for the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02072v1.pdf">Quo Vadis, Skeleton Action Recognition ?</a>

This paper primarily contributed towards benchmarking of exisiting skeleton human action recognition models on larger datasets like <a href = "http://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/Datasets/actionRecognition.asp">NTU-120</a> and also provides insight on how these models performs for *in the wild* data as well.

This paper introduced 2 new skeleton human action datasets:

- Skeletics-152
- Skeleton-mimetics

The details about each of these datasets can be found in [skeletics-152 README](./skeletics-152/README.md) and [skeleton-mimetics README](./skeleton-mimetics/README.md).
